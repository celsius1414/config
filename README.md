# config

Repo for some basic config files.

## ansiweather

* [fcambus / ansiweather](https://github.com/fcambus/ansiweather) - I install via [homebrew](https://github.com/homebrew).
* See [OpenWeatherMap's City List](http://openweathermap.org/help/city_list.txt) for location codes.

## lynx

* Amazing how much less crazy the modern web makes you when viewed through a [text-only browser](http://lynx.browser.org). Nigh on useful! &lt;3

## newsbeuter

* [akrennmair / newsbeuter](https://github.com/akrennmair/newsbeuter)
* It's been called the "Mutt of RSS feed readers", and I would just add that "Newsbeuter is News, Better."

## tmux

* [tmux](https://tmux.github.io) - terminal multiplexer. Which is fun to say. Terminal multiplexer. Sounds like a really complex wrestling move. Or something to do with high-powered lasers. Terminal multiplexer. Pew pew!
